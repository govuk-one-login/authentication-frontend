## Clone the repo

> Clone this repo to your local machine

```shell script
git@github.com:alphagov/di-authentication-frontend.git
```

Clones the repository to the `<your_folder_name` directory.

## Running the app in Docker

Before you can run the frontend app against the backend you will need to configure some environment variables.

### Set the Environment variables

Create a copy of the .env.sample file and rename it .env and fill in below values:

```
ENVIRONMENT=development
API_BASE_URL=
FRONTEND_API_BASE_URL=
SESSION_EXPIRY=30000
SESSION_SECRET=123456
API_KEY=
ANALYTICS_COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost
SERVICE_DOMAIN=localhost
```

You can find the `API_BASE_URL` in [Concourse](https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering/teams/verify/pipelines/di-authentication-deployment) under the outputs within the deploy-oidc-api-{environment} job, where {environment} is the name of the environment you want to connect to.

`UI_LOCALES` can be used be the stub to request specific locales when authorising.  Only 'en' and 'cy' are supported.

Run `docker-compose up` or the `startup.sh` script.

In `docker-compose.yaml` you will see three services which need to be started to run the frontend locally, the frontend itself, a lightweight stub client, and a redis instance.

When starting for the first time, or after a clean, the frontend will take a few minutes to start as node needs to install all the dependencies.

To find out if the application has started, open a console window on the frontend docker container and view the logs. If the server has started successfully you will see this message `Server listening on port 3000`.  If this does not appear try forcing node to restart by updating one of the `.njk` files.

There are two stub apps you can use to start a journey.

To start an auth only journey with MFA required ("Cm"), navigate to the stub app on port 2000 [http://localhost:2000](http://localhost:2000).  This acts like a local client to create a backend session and redirect to the start page.

To start an auth only journey with no MFA ("Cl"), navigate to the stub app on port 5000 [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Changes made locally will automatically be deployed after a few seconds. You should check the docker console to check that your changes have been picked up by the restart.

### Switching between different Vectors of Trust

You can further tweak the vector of trust (VTR) requested by the stub client on port 5000 by editing `docker-compose.yml`
and changing the `VTR` environment variable for the `di-auth-stub-no-mfa` service:

```
  di-auth-stub-no-mfa:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-stub
    links:
      - di-auth-frontend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=${ENVIRONMENT}
      - API_BASE_URL=${API_BASE_URL}
      - FRONTEND_API_BASE_URL=${FRONTEND_API_BASE_URL}
      - TEST_CLIENT_ID=${TEST_CLIENT_ID}
      - STUB_HOSTNAME=${STUB_HOSTNAME}
      - UI_LOCALES=${UI_LOCALES}
      - VTR=["Cl"] <== Edit this line
      - PORT=5000
```

You can also add an additional service with a different VTR by duplicating the `di-auth-stub-no-mfa` service,
giving it a new name and amending the `PORT` and `VTR` environment variables. The `ports` entry, must reflect the port
number in the `PORT` environment variable. Each service must have a unique port number.

### Running the tests

The unit tests have been written with Mocha and Supertest.

If the app is run in a container then the tests are run there too:

```shell script
docker exec -it di-authentication-frontend_di-auth-frontend /bin/sh

# yarn run test:unit
```

### Restarting the app

You can restart the app by re-running the `startup.sh` script, or restarting docker-compose.

For a clean start run `./startup.sh -c`

## Other useful yarn commands

Remember to run these commands in the docker container itself.

### Development

> To run the app in development mode with nodemon watching the files

```shell script
yarn dev
```

Starts a nodemon server serving the files from the `dist/`
directory.

### Build

> To build the app

```shell script
yarn build
```

### Start

> To run the built app

```shell script
yarn start
```

Starts a node server pointing to the entry point found in
the build directory.

### Unit tests

> To run the unit tests

```shell script
yarn test:unit
```

Runs all unit tests found in the `tests/unit/` directory
using mocha.

### Integration tests

> To run the integration tests

```shell script
yarn test:integration
```


### Install dependencies

> To install dependencies, run yarn install

```shell script
yarn install
```

Installs the dependencies required to run the application.

### Coverage

> To get a coverage report

```shell script
yarn test:coverage
```

### Linting

> To run lint checks

```shell script
yarn lint
```

Checks if the code conforms the linting standards.
